The [IgBLAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/) database was created as follows:

The V and J sequences for heavy and the light chains were combined to get a file each for V and J sequences.  

edit_imgt_file.pl script in the IgBLAST package was used to modify the IMGT files.
```
edit_imgt_file.pl human_IG_V.fa > human_IG_V
edit_imgt_file.pl human_IG_D.fa > human_IG_D
edit_imgt_file.pl human_IG_J.fa > human_IG_J
```

makeblastdb tool from NCBI blast 2.6.0+ suite was used to create the IgBLAST databases:
```
makeblastdb -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl -in human_IG_V
makeblastdb -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl -in human_IG_D
makeblastdb -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl -in human_IG_J
```
